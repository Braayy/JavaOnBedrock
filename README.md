# JavaOnBedrock
Allow Java Edtion players to join on Bedrock Edtion servers


Why the repository is empty?
----------------------------
I don't have resources to make this project now, but i'm creating this repository to remember me to work when i can.

Plans
----------------------------
I'm planning to use [MCProtocolLib](https://github.com/Steveice10/MCProtocolLib/) to manage the java edtion packets and [Protocol](https://github.com/NukkitX/Protocol) to manage the bedrock edition packets.
